implementation of a clocking system

"""
i am building a clocking system that takes in time and outputs the time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
its going to help the finance department to keep track of the time, and analyze the pay for employees. 

from the backend:

class employee:
    -name of employee
    -time in hours
    -time in minutes
    -time in seconds

class pay:
    - department name
    - department hourly rate
    @- hours worked
    - overtime
    -overtime rate
    

from the frontend:

-display the time upon arrival 
-display the hours worked
-display the total pay
-display the overtime

-how to build it:
integrate into the django project
integrate google authentication and authorization into the django project
integrate with google docs from database for downloads
